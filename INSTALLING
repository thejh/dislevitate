NO WARRANTY! IF YOU BRICK YOUR DEVICE WITH THIS, IT'S NOT MY FAULT!

First, verify using the xray app from xray.io that your device is vulnerable to the Levitator
exploit.

Now, run this command:

    uname -a

Make sure that the output is exactly

    Linux localhost 2.6.32.9-gb08c3c8 #1 PREEMPT Fri Jun 3 11:40:33 CST 2011 armv7l GNU/Linux

If it's different, it probably won't work.

Next, copy the file dislevitate.ko from https://github.com/thejh/dislevitate/raw/master/dislevitate.ko
on the Defy (e.g. on the sdcard).

All the following commands must be run as root.

Make /system writable:

    mount -o remount,rw /system

Copy the module into the directory with all the other modules:

    cp /sdcard/dislevitate.ko /system/lib/modules/
    chmod 644 /system/lib/modules/dislevitate.ko

Now we will test the protection without activating it permanently (in case stuff goes wrong):

    insmod /system/lib/modules/dislevitate.ko; dmesg | grep levitator

If your device crashes (which shouldn't happen), don't continue with these instructions. What
should happen is that you see something like this:

    <6>[ 1533.541809] Hello android kernel... going to patch the levitator security hole, please wait...
    <6>[ 1533.559143] done! you should be protected against the levitator exploit now!

In this case, the patch works and you can install it permanently. However, if the second line is something like

    wrong instruction encountered, could not patch the levitator vulnerability!

the patch won't work and you should stop.

If you want to, you can also verify whether it worked by checking the Levitator vuln in X-Ray again - it
shouldn't exist anymore.

Now you are ready to install the patch permanently. The kernel needs to be patched on each boot, so we will
create an init file:

    nano /etc/init.d/20dislevitate

Now enter the following lines of code:

    #!/system/bin/sh
    
    # patch the levitator vuln in the running kernel!
    insmod /system/lib/modules/dislevitate.ko

Afterwards, press CTRL+Y, then Y, then enter. Now, set the correct permissions:

    chmod 755 /etc/init.d/20dislevitate

Now, reboot and check in X-Ray again. The vuln should be gone now.
