relative destination offset: 0xc01e0640 - 0xc01d6088 = 0xa5b8 = 10100101 10111000
relative destination offset >>2: 0x296e  (must actually be two less because the pointer is ahead)

Branch instructions contain a signed 2's complement 24-bit offset. This is shifted left
two bits, sign extended to 32 bits, and added to the PC. The instruction can therefore
specify a branch of +/- 32Mbytes. The branch offset must take account of the prefetch
operation, which causes the PC to be 2 words (8 bytes) ahead of the current
instruction. Branches beyond +/- 32Mbytes must use an offset or absolute destination
which has been previously loaded into a register. In this case the PC should be
manually saved in R14 if a branch with link type operation is required.
